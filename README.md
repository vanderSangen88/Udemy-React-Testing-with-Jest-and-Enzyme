# Udemy-React-Testing-with-Jest-and-Enzyme

## Section 1: Introduction to Jest, Enzyme and TDD

### 1. Welcome and introduction

Use testing to improve React code.

- Better organization
- More maintainable
- Fewer bugs

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Basic React (optinal Redux)
- Very basic git

### 2. TDD: What and Why

TDD (Test-Driven Development): write tests before writing code.

1. Write "shell" function
2. Write tests
3. Tests fail
4. Write code
5. Tests pass

#### Why TDD?

- More efficient
  - Re-run tests "for free" after changes
- Better code
  - Better organized (plan before you code)
  - More testable (no rewriting code for tests)
  - Fewer bugs (caught sooner, regression)
  - Great code coverage

### 3. create-react-app
